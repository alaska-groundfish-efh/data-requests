# product-requests
Empty repo mainly for storing and tracking data requests from other teams (see Issues/Projects). 

## Requesters
Are you a scientist interested in an EFH data product? Please turn your data product request into an [**Issue**](https://github.com/alaska-groundfish-efh/product-requests/issues) so we can track it. If you have questions about data products or requests, contact Margaret Siple (NOAA).

## Analysts
If you are an analyst, put products in [**our Google Drive folder**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OLiyh0nlnQQ3LKkdDhd6xqrFarSK0I7Y?usp=sharing) for sharing when you are finished, prefixed with the issue number. If you wrote code to create any of the products, deposit it in the [**fulfillment-code folder**](https://github.com/alaska-groundfish-efh/product-requests/tree/main/fulfillment-code), also prefixed with the issue number.
